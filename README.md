The Board of Directors of a financial firm, VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS are potentially reviewing the 1000 potentially interesting startups and deciding on which one they are going to invest on.
The criteria for selecting these startups are based on three factors:
•	High revenue
•	Low Expense 
•	Top Growth
So the here, we need to solve the business problem for the company. We need to find which business represents the best investment opportunity.
